## Courses

* [AI4Chemistry course](https://github.com/schwallergroup/ai4chem_course) - The Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Chemistry taught in Spring 2023 at EPFL (CH-457). It is a course with a lot of hands-on exercises. Experience in Python programming and machine learning (ML) will help you to get up to speed quickly.
* [Practical Programming](https://schwallergroup.github.io/practical-programming-in-chemistry/) – 
This course offers a thorough introduction to programming for chemists and chemical engineers using Python, covering fundamental concepts and tools relevant to chemical tasks, from Git to the RDKit. The exercises are freely accessible.
