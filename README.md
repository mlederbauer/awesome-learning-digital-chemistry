## Courses

* [AI4Chemistry course](https://github.com/schwallergroup/ai4chem_course) - The Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Chemistry taught in Spring 2023 at EPFL (CH-457). It is a course with a lot of hands-on exercises. Experience in Python programming and machine learning (ML) will help you to get up to speed quickly.
* [Practical Programming](https://schwallergroup.github.io/practical-programming-in-chemistry/) – 

## Tutorials
* [VolkamerLab Talktorials on CADD](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/talktorials.html) –
* [Practical Cheminformatic Tutorials by Patrick Walters](https://github.com/PatWalters/practical_cheminformatics_tutorials) – Jupyter notebooks and Google colab notebooks for learning Cheminformatics. From fundamentals of concepts in cheminformatics over clustering, SAR analysis, machine learning and active learning: This course covers everything!

## Communities

* [OpenBioML](https://www.openbioml.org/) - OpenBioML is a decentralized, collaborative research community founded on the belief that open source machine learning and open science can accelerate biotechnology.
